# GraphQL Sync Demo

A simple demo showing how to sync data using the Box and Dice GraphQL API.  
No libraries, no ORMs, no extras - just a barebones example focused on syncing.  
It does not handle errors, include tests, or do rate limiting.

## Setup

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and update it with your values.
2. Ensure Docker is installed.
3. From the command line:
```
   $ docker compose build
   $ docker compose up
```
